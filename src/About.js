                    At present, I mostly work with Javascript and use Vue.js as
                    my framework of choice. I would love to collaborate, read
                    code that isn't my own, and accumulate invaluable knowledge
                    working under and alongside other developers in a team. I
                    take pride in my work and since the name of the game is
                    lifelong learning, I'm sure to do just that in order to
                    deliver products that exceed end user expectations. I'm
                    currently learning Node.js and state management with Redux
                    and see myself growing into a full-stack web based
                    developer.
