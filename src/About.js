                    At present, I have experience working with Javascript and
                    Vue.js. I would love to collaborate, read code that isn't my
                    own, and accumulate invaluable knowledge working alongside
                    other developers in a team. I take pride in my work and
                    since the name of the game is lifelong learning, I'm sure to
                    do just that in order to deliver products that exceed end
                    user expectations. I'm currently learning Redux and see
                    myself growing into a full-stack developer.
