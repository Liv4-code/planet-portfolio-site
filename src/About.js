                    At present, I mostly work with Javascript and use Vue.js as
                    my framework of choice. My development involves creating
                    UI's that display data in a way that's pleasing and relevant
                    to the end user. I would love to collaborate, read code that
                    isn't my own, and accumulate invaluable knowledge working
                    under and alongside other developers in my team. I take
                    pride in my work and since the name of the game is lifelong
                    learning, I'm sure to do just that in order to deliver
                    products that exceed end user expectations. I'm currently
                    learning Node.js and state management with Redux and see
                    myself growing into a full-stack web based developer.
